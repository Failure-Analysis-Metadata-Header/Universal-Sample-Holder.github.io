# Universal Sample Holder

In semiconductor failure analysis (FA), multiple analysis steps using different measurement methods across a possibly large chain of tools are typically carried out to identify the root cause failure. In order to enable a higher degree of automation, the machines used for the different analysis steps must be able to communicate with each other through a standardized interface. Such a standardized interface is delivered by the FA Standardized File Header (Link to github page) which provides a standard schema for the storage of metadata associated with analysis images or other measurement data types. 

Directly linked to the Standardized File Header and the automation process of workflows, is the Universal Sample Holder. 
Currently, in the state of the art workflow at the FA, each measurement tool has its own sample holder. This means that every time a sample needs to be moved from one tool to another, it has to be removed and reattached. This process is time-consuming and increases the risk of damaging the sample. Furthermore, this setup complicates the task for the FA engineer to relocate a previously identified failure location if the location is in the nano-scale or not directly visible in the next tool of the workflow. These issues are addressed by the Universal Sample Holder, which serves as a standardized sample holder for each measurement device in a FA lab. It facilitates the transformation of the failure coordinates from one tool to another using its alignment marks:
